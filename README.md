# centos-6-vault-image

Because of CentOS 6 End of life mirrorlist is not accessible from centos image.
To fix this issue, new image with changed baseurl to http://vault.centos.org added.

It should be available via `scorpio2002/centos-6-vault-image:6.10`
So you can change your image from `centos:6` to it.
